# Highlighter

When you only want to highlight words in a stream (and not grep or filter anything), this tool is for you.

## Installation

```pip install https://github.com/mattissf/highlighter/archive/master.zip```

It will install an executable script called ```hl```.

## Usage

```
echo "a long sentence with some words that should be highlighted" | hl sentence words
```

Will highlight ```sentence``` and ```words```
